            </div>
            <p>Trees & Bees was established in 2021, but making honey and maple syrup has been in the family for nearly a century. As if owning and operating a dairy farm wasn't enough, my great grandfather bought a few acres of woods just a couple miles from the farm where he would later build a sugar shack and place his beehives. Since then, the operation has grown and evolved considerably, as have our values and views on sustainable farming. It is our hope that creating and encouraging more sustainable practices will allow future generations to enjoy and benefit from the same things my great grandfather did, nearly a century ago.</p>

            <p>At Trees & Bees, we create honey and maple syrup products with no additives or artificial products. We are committed to honoring nature's recipe - creating natural products that are good for your body and good to nature. Our maple syrup and honey contain no artificial sweeteners and our candles are made of 100% beeswax with natural scent extracts. We are certified organic, meaning that our operations and, in turn, our products are not contaminated with antibiotics, pesticides, or other environmental pollutants or chemicals. We guarantee that our products are 100% full of only the good stuff. </p>
            <p>If you couldn't tell, we really care about sustainability here. We recogize the harmful impact that pesticides and herbicides have on our environment and think we can do better. We've adopted alternative and more sustainable agricultural practices across our operations to control pest populations and weed growth, as well as protect and maintain our environmental assets at the same time.</p>
